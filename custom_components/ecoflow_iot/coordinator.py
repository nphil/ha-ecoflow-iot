"""Data coordinator: MQTT-first with HTTP polling fallback.

Live data arrives via MQTT and is pushed to entities immediately. The periodic
``DataUpdateCoordinator`` tick only hits the cloud REST API when MQTT is
disconnected or has gone stale, when a device has gone too long without a
*full* quota snapshot (MQTT pushes are partial, so individual fields can
freeze while the device still looks fresh), and to refresh any HTTP-only
fields. A watchdog on the same tick force-reconnects the broker session when
it claims to be CONNECTED but no device has delivered data for several
cycles (a silently dead connection otherwise degrades to HTTP cadence
forever — only a reload would restore live updates). Control
commands are published over MQTT (awaiting the device's ``set_reply``) and fall
back to an HTTP ``PUT`` if MQTT is unavailable or unacknowledged.

        A connection can look up while being silently dead (broker-side
        subscription loss, half-open socket, orphaned session). The HTTP
        fallback keeps data flowing at the poll cadence, but only a reconnect
        restores live updates — the same effect as reloading the entry,
        without the reload.
